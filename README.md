Small android application to generate passwords, back-ported from javascript, based on the site [https://www.passwordchart.com].

I made this app back in 2017 for my personal use but I figured some people might have some use for it.
The code is dirty and based on an old Android version, but I upgraded the build tools to the latest version that can still build it without changing the code.
For the rest, feel free to update it.

No INTERNET permission required since everything is performed on the client side.
